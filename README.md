# Grammy Awards Website Audience Analysis

This capstone project was completed as part of the Global Career Accelerator - Coding for Data Program, in collaboration with the Grammy 
Awards. I worked with real data from both websites owned by The Recording Academy to examine the impact of splitting the two sites and to 
analyze trends and audience behavior on each.

## Key Tasks

- Analyzed and visualized data using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly.
- Derived conclusions based on the data visualizations.
